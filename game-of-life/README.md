# Game of Life

For a space that is 'populated':
  - each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude
  - each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation
  - each cell with two or three neighbors survives

For a space that is 'empty' or 'unpopulated'
  - each cell with three neighbors becomes populated
